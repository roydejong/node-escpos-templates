# escpos-templates

**Generic template engine for formatting [node-escpos](https://github.com/song940/node-escpos) receipts**.

## Installation

Add the `escpos-templates` package to your project:

```bash
yarn add escpos-templates
# or
npm install escpos-templates
```

## Usage

Instantiate `EscPosTemplate` with the template text, then provide it with a `printer` instance and your variables to
directly drive the printer interface:

```javascript
import {EscPosTemplate} from "node-escpos-templates";
import {Printer, Network} from "escpos";

const device = new Network("127.0.0.1", 1234);
const printer = new Printer(device);

const template = new EscPosTemplate(`print \"Hello {{theName}}!"; feed 2; cut;`);
const myVars = {theName: "Bob"};

device.open((err) => {
  // Directly drive printer instructions from the template, with optional variables
  template.print(printer, myVars);
  printer.close();
});
```

## Creating templates

This project uses a simple custom syntax to define print templates.

Each print instruction must be placed on separate line, and/or seperated with a semicolon `;`.

### "Hello world" example

A very simple template that prints some text, feeds two lines, then cuts the paper:

```
print "Hello world!";
feed 2;
beep;
cut;
```

### "Hello world" with variables example

When calling `print()` you can provide an object of template variables.

You can refer to these anywhere in a template string by using the `{{variableName}}` syntax. You can also refer to
variables directly as arguments to print commands.

```
# Print "Hello Bob!"
print "Hello {{name}}!";

# Print "Bob" 
print name;
```

```javascript
template.print(printer, {name: "Bob"});
```

### Advanced example with formatting and loop

## Supported commands

These are the commands that are currently implemented for use in the templates:

| Syntax          | Details                                       |
|-----------------|-----------------------------------------------|
| `print [text]`  | Prints one line of `text`                     |
| `feed [n]`      | Feed `n` amount of lines.                     |
| `beep [n] [t]`  | Beep `n` times for `t` Ã— 100 ms duration      |
| `cut`           | Feeds 5 lines then performs a full cut        |
| `cashdraw [p]`  | Pulses the cash drawer kick on pin `p`        | 
| `align [a]`     | Align text `left`, `center` or `right`        | 
| `bold [t]`      | Set bold / emphasis to `off` or `on`          | 
| `underline [t]` | Set underline mode to `off`, `on` or `double` |
| `font [f]`      | Set font to `a`, `b`, or `c`                  | 
| `reset`         | Resets formatting options to their defaults   | 

## Additional information

### Template syntax
Some details about the template syntax this library uses:
- Each line is evaluated separately;
  - Empty lines are ignored
  - Lines that start with a hash `#` are ignored (comment)
- Each line is parsed for instructions;
  - Multiple instructions can be split using a semicolon `;`
  - Each instruction starts with an alphanumeric opcode (e.g. `print`)
  - Each instruction can have any amount of arguments, split by a space or tab
- Each argument can be passed as a string literal or variable;
  - Double quotes should `"` wrap around a string literal
  - Backslash ` \ ` can be used as an escape character anywhere
  - Any argument that isn't a string literal must be an integer or variable reference
  - Some variables are predefined (e.g. `true`, `false` and options listed in the table above)
